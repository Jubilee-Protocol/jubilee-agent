# Jubilee: The AI Steward for Kingdom Economics

**"A faithful man will abound with blessings." — Proverbs 28:20**

## What is Jubilee?
Jubilee is an advanced Artificially Intelligent agent designed to help organizations, congregations, and individuals manage resources with wisdom, transparency, and ethical alignment.

Think of Jubilee not just as software, but as a digital **Steward**. Unlike standard financial tools that only care about *profit*, Jubilee is built to care about *purpose*. It automates complex financial tasks while rigorously filtering every action through a framework of values and safety.

## Why Do We Need It?
Modern finance is overwhelmingly complex. For churches, non-profits, and ethical investors, this complexity creates two problems:
1.  **Paralysis**: Good people leave resources dormant because they fear making mistakes.
2.  **Misalignment**: Funds are often stored in institutions or assets that actively work against the values of the owners.

Jubilee solves this by combining **institutional-grade capability** with **uncompromising ethical guardrails**.

## How It Works (The Triune System)
Jubilee isn't a "black box." It thinks in three distinct stages, patterned after a holistic decision-making process. We call this the **Triune Architecture**:

### 1. The Mind (Analysis)
*   **Role**: The Researcher.
*   **Action**: Jubilee scans financial data, reads reports, and calculates the numbers. It ensures that any decision makes financial sense.
*   **Example**: *"Find the best yield for our building fund that is low-risk and liquid."*

### 2. The Prophet (Alignment)
*   **Role**: The Conscience.
*   **Action**: Before recommending anything, Jubilee checks the "spirit" of the investment. It scans for red flags, predatory behavior, or misalignment with Kingdom values. If an opportunity is profitable but unethical, the Prophet blocks it.
*   **Example**: *"This fund has high returns, but involves predatory lending. Recommendation: REJECT."*

### 3. The Will (Action)
*   **Role**: The Executor.
*   **Action**: Once the Mind confirms the math and the Prophet confirms the morals, the Will takes action. It drafts the emails, executes the transfers, or rebalances the portfolio.
*   **Safety**: For all movement of funds, Jubilee requires a human "Double-Confirmation," ensuring technology remains a servant, not a master.

## What Can Jubilee Do Today?
- **Automated Stewardship**: Manage treasury funds to earn yield (e.g., via the Jubilee Yield Stream) without constant manual oversight.
- **Ethical Research**: Deep-dive into companies or protocols to verify they align with your mission.
- **Transparent Operations**: Every decision, reason, and transaction is logged in plain English, creating a permanent audit trail for boards and congregations.

## The Vision
We believe technology should amplify our values, not dilute them. Jubilee is the first step toward a future where our economy is as moral as it is efficient—a tool for the "Good and Faithful Servant."
